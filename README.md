# koyorai-translate-frontend

Web frontend for the Koyorai Translator. This directory contains code for the
web app itself, plus the code for the Flask api that powers the webapp. Code
that consumes the uploaded audio data and produces the translation data will be
located in a seperate service so that scaling of web servers and translation
servers can be handled seperately.
